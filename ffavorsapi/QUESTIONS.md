what is a site id



why are the params not just a json of key value


{
    "Report_ID": 36,
    "Schedule_ID": 9,
    params: {
        "STATE1": "CO",
        "STATE2": null,
        "STATE3": null
    },
}

what is the type of the params api expecting?

does schedules return all schedules or only runs due
